Build 1.7.0-f5 _Build 001 5/18/2017
--------------
1.7 compatibility compile.

Build 1.6.0-f4 _Build 002 12/11/2016
+ new extra options with logging turned on to see some basic stats.
+ fixed a major bug with 'normal' tree burnings where we were previously not catching
  tress that had disaster ID's but had disasterID==0 (dummy), we used to treat that as diaster.
  we righfully treat it as non-disaster now. Seems in 1.6 every "normal" structure fire is really a 
  disaster...just a dummy\untracked one.
