#TreeFireControl Version 1.6.0-f4 
--------------------


This mod allows changing via the options menu
The rate at which trees will catch fire.
The two main settings are for:

Trees that catch fire normally (Not connected to a disaster event).
Trees that catch fire associated with a real disaster.
The percentage, is that relative to the original game code.
100% == no change.
0% == disable trees from ever burning.

Inbetween is the % chance a tree will burn when the game normally asks it too.
So setting 80% would mean the mod will block on average 20% of games calls to burn trees.

*Note* - If you are manually trying to trigger a forest fire.. we always allow the first tree to burn,
so long as you have don't have things disabled.

Disable normal building fires - set the global flag to disable normal building fires (existing ones still burn but no new ones will happen) 

Enable logging - is more for me the developer, just logs extra stuff to your log.
Enabling logging also enables extra information when in the game an on the screen.
Shows how many requests there were to burn trees, and what type and how many we ignored for each type.

*You may change your options In-Game at anytime, they are effective immediately.
